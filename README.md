# Quanteda-Tutorial

To access the first part of the tutorial click on the launch binder image: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewmoles2/Quanteda-Tutorial/main?urlpath=shiny%2Fpart_1%2F)

To access the second part of the tutorial click on the launch binder image: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewmoles2/Quanteda-Tutorial/main?urlpath=shiny%2Fpart_2%2F)

Note that the tutorial might take **a few minutes to load**. Once you click on the binder image, and see a page that says MyBinder with a spinning wheel, maybe go make a hot drink and wait for it to load. For context, it is taking time to load as we are *building* an image to host the tutorial. It will be much faster the next time you try and load it.
